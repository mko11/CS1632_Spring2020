This course provides students with a broad understanding of modern software testing and quality assurance. Although it will cover testing theory, the emphasis is on providing practical skills in software testing currently used in industry. To that end, it will cover: manual and automated tests, test-driven development, performance testing, and understanding and developing a testing strategy.

## Grading

* Projects (75%):
  * Deliverable 1 - 10%
  * Deliverable 2 - 15%
  * Deliverable 3 - 15%
  * Deliverable 4 - 10%
  * Deliverable 5 - 25%
* Midterms (20%):
  * Midterm 1 - 10%
  * Midterm 2 - 10%
* Participation (5%)

Although you are not required to come to every class, it is recommended that you do.  You _are_ required to be present for exams.  Exams will NOT be allowed to be made up except with a valid and verified excuse (generally medical - others are left to the discretion of the instructor).

Many days include an in-class exercise.  Exercises will not be graded, but it is _strongly_ recommended that you show up for these as they will allow you to verify that you know the basics of the tools being taught, can have them installed, etc.  If you are having trouble with the deliverable, the instructor will always ask to see the results of the relevant exercise _before_ helping with the deliverable.  In other words, finishing the exercise is necessary proof that you have done the bare minimum in understanding the project before asking for additional help.

The following grading scale will be used.  Note that I generally do _not_ round grades up; however, I do provide several opportunities for extra credit during the course of the term for the completion of certain exercises, attendance, etc.

Score  | Grade
-----: | ------------------------------
100.00-93.00 | A (A+ for extraordinary work)
92.99-90.00  | A-
89.99-87.00  | B+
86.99-83.00  | B
82.99-80.00  | B-
79.99-77.00  | C+
76.99-73.00  | C
72.99-70.00  | C-
69.99-67.00  | D+
66.99-63.00  | D
62.99-60.00  | D-
59.99-0.00   | F

All groups are expected to do their own work on the group projects, and students to do entirely their own work on the other projects.  Projects may be analyzed with the Stanford _moss_ system to detect unauthorized collaboration between groups or individuals.  Any student caught collaborating or cheating will, at a minimum, automatically receive a 0 (zero) for that exam or project, and may be penalized more harshly based on University of Pittsburgh academic policy.

Assignments should be committed and pushed to GitHub to _a private repository_ and shared with the TA and me by the due date.  All assignments also require write-ups that needs to be submitted via courseweb by the due date.  The format of the write-up will be specified on each assignment.  Students are encourged to commit early and often to the GitHub repository as commit history will be used as the ground truth for proof of work (especially as it relates to a group project).  Also, frequent commits help avoid conflicts when working on the same files as your partner.  

Late assignments will receive a -5 percentage point penalty per day (e.g., if you would have received a 90% on an assignment, but you turned it in 3 days late, you would receive 90 - 15 = 75%.)

Please ensure that you have a student GitHub account so that you can make private repositories.  This is free and available here: https://education.github.com/

If any disputes from groups arise, I will assume that GitHub is the "ground truth".  For example, if Partner A insists that they did all the work, but GitHub history shows only commits by Partner B, I will assume that Partner B has done all the work.

It is recommended you keep all of your graded assignments until final grades are posted and accepted, in order to resolve any discrepancies in grading.

## Group Work

Please submit this [Partnership Contract](partnership_contract.txt) to
courseweb as soon as possible.  Your expectations as a group member are
outlined clearly on the contract.

## Attendance

Regular attendance is expected for this course.  Attendance will be taken randomly throughout the semester.  The instructor will try to ensure that all information on the exams and projects will be available via slides, but simply reading the slides and textbook may be insufficient to understand the concepts thoroughly.  In addition, there will be in-class exercises without which you may find completing class projects extremely difficult.

## Project Details

* **Deliverable 1:** Developing a test plan and traceability matrix for a system.
* **Deliverable 2:** Developing unit tests for a console-based application.
* **Deliverable 3:** Developing a simple web application system with the help of automated systems testing.
* **Deliverable 4:** Performance testing and optimization of an application.
* **Deliverable 5:** Developing and testing an application using both static and dynamic testing.

## Exam Details

There will be two midterm examinations, each worth 10% of your grade.  A study guide will be posted approximately one week before each exam.

## Programming Language Selection

For all deliverables, the class will use Java with the appropriate frameworks (JUnit, Mockito, Selenium).  Projects written in other languages or using alternative frameworks will not be accepted.

## Participating in Class

Questions and comments are invited and strongly encouraged.  If you have a view
point or experience that may enrich the class, please jump in (after raising
your hand)!  There is also going to be an active discussion board on courseweb
maintained throughout the semester where you can post your thoughts.  I will be posting frequently to the board myself to clarify and expand upon concepts that I didn't have time to explain fully in class.

## Disability Services Statement

"The Office of Disability Resources and Services (DRS) provides a broad range of support services to assist students with disabilities. Services include, but are not limited to, tape-recorded textbooks, sign language interpreters, adaptive and transportation. Contact DRS at 412-648-7890 or 412-383-1355 (TTY) in 216 William Pitt Union or see www.drs.pitt.edu for more computer technology, Braille translation, and nonstandard exam arrangements, DRS can also assist students with accessibility to campus housing information."

The instructor will work to the best of their ability to accommodate any issues arising from a disability that a student has, but he must be aware of it in order to accommodate it.  Please inform me as soon as possible if you have a disability which you think may hinder your success in the course and we (along with the DRS) should be able to work around it.

## Academic Integrity Statement

Cheating/plagiarism will _not_ be tolerated. Students suspected of violating the University of Pittsburgh Policy on Academic Integrity, from the February 1974 Senate Committee on Tenure and Academic Freedom reported to the Senate Council, will be required to participate in the outlined procedural process as initiated by the instructor. A minimum sanction of a zero score for the quiz or exam will be imposed.

View the complete policy at www.cfo.pitt.edu/policies/policy/02/02-03-02.html.

Some guidelines:

_1. For all graded assignments and exams, viewing the work done by your classmates (or a 3rd source) before submission is considered cheating.  Aiding this activity is also considered cheating.  The only exception is your designated group members for your group projects._

_2. For ungraded in-class exercises, you are allowed (and encouraged) to look at your classmates' work and discuss it.  If you get ample help for the exercises, you should rarely need additional help for the projects._

_3. If you need additional help for the projects, your best source is your instructor._
